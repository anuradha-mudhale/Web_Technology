Q.difference between package.json and package log.json

Q.what is nodejs
it is used for js code run outside the browser
to run js code outside the browser
D:\Web Technology>node --version
v24.12.0
to run
node file_name.js

Q.types of datatypes in js

primitive       
1.number
2.string
3.boolean
4.undefined
5.null
6.symbol
7.

non-primitive:
1]object

Q.what is diff between const let var
const does not change value
var has bug which is it give outside scope values let only change block of code
so we use let and const

let var reassign redeclare

go to terminal from folder 
and write code . it open vs code


== --->condition check
=== --->condition or datatype check



2.Conversion Operators


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Concepts--------------------------------------------------------------------------1️⃣ What what is Web Technology?

Web Technology refers to the collection of tools, programming languages, frameworks, and protocols used to design, develop, and run websites and web applications on the internet. It includes frontend technologies, backend technologies, databases, and servers that work together to deliver content to users.

2️⃣ Real-time Examples of Web Technology

Amazon – Online shopping and payment system

Google – Search engine and web services

Gmail – Web-based email application

Netflix – Online video streaming platform

Online Banking Websites – Money transfer and account management

These applications use web technology to provide real-time services over the internet.

3️⃣ What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting and object oriented programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It allows developers to handle user actions, validate forms, manipulate the DOM, and update web content without reloading the page.

4️⃣ Which file extension is used for JavaScript?

The file extension used for JavaScript is:

.js

Example:

script.js

5️⃣ Why do we use Node.js?

Node.js is used to run JavaScript code outside the browser. It allows JavaScript to be used on the server side for building backend applications, handling client requests, accessing databases, and creating fast and scalable web applications.

6️⃣ Difference between package.json and package-lock.json
package.json

Contains project metadata and dependencies

Specifies dependency version ranges

Managed by the developer

package-lock.json

Automatically generated file

Stores exact versions of installed packages

Ensures consistency across different systems

7️⃣ What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser and is mainly used for backend development.

8️⃣ Types of Data Types in JavaScript
Primitive Data Types

Number

String

Boolean

Undefined

Null

Symbol

BigInt

Non-Primitive Data Types

Object (arrays, functions, objects)

9️⃣ Difference between var, let, and const

var: Function scoped, can be redeclared and reassigned, may cause scope-related bugs

let: Block scoped, can be reassigned, cannot be redeclared

const: Block scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared

🔟 Difference between == and ===

== compares only values

=== compares both value and data type

Example:

5 == "5"   // true
5 === "5"  // false

1️⃣1️⃣ How to run JavaScript using Node.js?

Check version:

node --version


Run file:

node file_name.js


Key Concepts Summary

+true → converts boolean to number (1)

+"" → converts empty string to number (0)

variable++ → post-increment (increment after use)

++variable → pre-increment (increment before use)

✅ Exam-ready conclusion

The unary plus operator converts values into numbers. Post-increment increases the value after usage, while pre-increment increases the value before usage.

What is DOM
DOM is a programming interface that represents a web page as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to access and manipulate HTML elements dynamically.
